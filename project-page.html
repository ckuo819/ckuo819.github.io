              While 826LA’s Field Trip Program aimed to support students from underserved communities through creative
              writing experiences, there was a lack of data on long-term learning outcomes, equitable access across
              school demographics, and alignment with shifting neighborhood populations.

              Before the Pulse Survey, SCU lacked a quick and consistent way to gather student feedback. Traditional
              surveys were long, infrequent, and often too slow to inform real-time decisions. Students also felt
              disengaged, unsure if their responses led to change. To solve this, we designed short (1–5 minute) surveys
              focused on timely, relevant topics. We used validated scales for consistency and tracked changes over
              time. Strategic reminders and transparent reporting helped build trust and increase participation. Clear
              consent and confidentiality measures ensured students felt safe sharing their experiences.

              This project taught me how to conduct human-centered research rooted in equity and community engagement.
              By integrating observations, stakeholder voices, and data-driven insights, we moved beyond evaluation to
              actionable design thinking. I saw how small adjustments—like clearer communication or structured
              follow-up—can significantly enhance impact for under-resourced communities.
