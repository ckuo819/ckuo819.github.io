                <strong>Pain Point:</strong> Uneven school participation due to informal outreach networks.<br/>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> Recommended targeted outreach strategies and clarification of logistical support (e.g., transportation).<br/><br/>
                <strong>Pain Point:</strong> Aggregated post-trip surveys lacked local insights.<br/>
                <strong>Solution:</strong> Advocated for a chapter-specific feedback mechanism.</p>

                <p>Through this project, I gained invaluable experience in user research and data analysis. I learned how to effectively gather and analyze qualitative data, identify patterns in user behavior, and translate these insights into actionable recommendations. This experience has strengthened my ability to approach problems systematically and create solutions that truly address user needs.</p>
