We suggests to create a collapsible sidebar menu can help students locate things quickly, and reducing the time of navigation.<br>Search Bar Improvement: the search bar needs to gives students relevant search suggestions. And we suggest to also match the autofill search suggestions with the existing subcategories.</p>

                <p>Since the workday system in Santa Clara university's students portal are newly launch when we decide to do this project, we got lots of complain and issues when we conducted the interviews. And we struggle to pain points the main struggles that we want to focus on. After discussed with our professor, we decided to use post notes to categorize and organize all the pain points that reflected from our experience and from the interviews and find out the biggest categories and focus on that, which is the navigation in workday student portal system.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="content-box">
                <p>One thing is that we all agreed that it would have been really interesting to have also collected data from SCU's staff as they also use Workday. We would want to investigate whether they have the same problems as students do using workday or if their problems are entirely different and how so. We also reflected on the possibly of redoing this project and one thing we would've have done differently is to try our hand at card sorting ourselves. To briefly define what card sorting is, it's where we would ask users to organize cards into groups that they feel is appropriate to them. We would do this with the categories and subcategories to get a clear picture of how students would organize the categories themselves for ourselves and we'd then present that information. Additionally we'd like to point out that during our process of researching, workday has been updating some of its platform features. For example, in the academics tab they added a whole new box for registration requirements.</p>
