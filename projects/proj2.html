                <p>We built a protocol for launching Santa Clara University's first-ever Pulse Survey, including the design, administration, and analysis process. This initiative aimed to foster better communication between students and the university by capturing real-time student feedback on pressing issues.</p>

               <p>Before the Pulse Survey, SCU lacked a quick and consistent way to gather student feedback. Traditional surveys were long, infrequent, and often too slow to inform real-time decisions. Students also felt disengaged, unsure if their responses led to change. To solve this, we designed short (1–5 minute) surveys focused on timely, relevant topics. We used validated scales for consistency and tracked changes over time. Strategic reminders and transparent reporting helped build trust and increase participation. Clear consent and confidentiality measures ensured students felt safe sharing their experiences.</p>

                <p>Leading the Pulse Survey project deepened my skills in <strong>UX research, data analysis (SPSS)</strong>, and <strong>institutional collaboration</strong>. It also reinforced the value of <strong>empathetic design</strong>—listening to users (students) and translating their voices into <strong>actionable institutional insights</strong>. Creating a protocol from scratch taught me how to <strong>balance research rigor with real-world constraints</strong> like time, engagement, and accessibility. Most importantly, I learned how data-driven practices can meaningfully improve the student experience.</p>
