              Sidebar: The original sidebar only contains 4 categories. We suggests to create a collapsible sidebar menu

              Improvement:  the search bar needs to gives students relevant search suggestions. And we suggest to also
              match the autofill search suggestions with the existing subcategories.</span

            points the main struggles that we want to focus on. After discussed with our professor, we decided to use
            post notes to categorize and organize all the pain points that reflected from our experience and from the
            interviews and find out the biggest categories and focus on that, which is the navigation in workday student

            One thing is that we all agreed that it would have been really interesting to have also collected data from
            SCU’s staff as they also use Workday. We would want to investigate whether they have the same problems as
            students do using workday or if their problems are entirely different and how so. We also reflected on the
            possibly of redoing this project and one thing we would’ve have done differently is to try our hand at card
            sorting ourselves. To briefly define what card sorting is, it’s where we would ask  users to organize cards
            into groups that they feel is appropriate to them. We would do this with the categories and subcategories to
            get a clear picture of how students would organize the categories themselves for ourselves and we’d then
            present that information. Additionally we’d like to point out that during our process of researching,
            workday has been updating some of its platform features. For example, in the academics tab they added a
            whole new box for registration requirements.
